Praseodymium is soft, silvery, malleable, and ductile. It was prepared in relatively pure form in 1931. 
It is somewhat more resistant to corrosion in air than europium, lanthanum, cerium, or neodymium, 
but it does develop a green oxide coating that "spalls" away when exposed to air. The metal should 
be stored under an inert atmosphere or under mineral oil or petroleum.

The rare-earth oxides, including Pr2O3, are among the most refractory substances known. 
It is a component of misch metal, used for lighter flints, and of the glass in welders' goggles.
